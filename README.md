# HeDGe: a web-based Heraldic Design Generator in HTML, SVG, CSS, XSLT and Javascript.

## Introduction
This is the code for a web application for creating personal heraldic devices. There is a 
[live version of HeDGe](http://www.heraldicdevice.org.uk/),
but it currently only works in Mozilla Firefox, in my recent testing at least.

## Licensing
All parts are licensed as the main licence except where otherwise noted, including the lions, eagle and dragon drawings
(see main application page Acknowledgements for full details).

## Technology
The main graphics technology standard is [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).
The  transformations between HeDGe markup language in XML and SVG are done in XSLT. The styling is done in CSS.
